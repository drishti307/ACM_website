            <h2 class="font-weight-bold">ABOUT</h2>
            
<p>To protect yourself from cyber attacks or to build a future in protecting others from such attacks and to assess your knowledge in this field, ACM IGDTUW under the banner of  अद्वय is bringing to you the CYBER SECURITY workshop Windows Exploit 101 and Quiz!!</p>
<h2 class="font-weight-bold">Rules for Quiz</h2>
    <p>The cybersecurity quiz will be based on the trends/terminologies/tools/techniques related to the field of Information-Security. The contest will be held in three rounds – Beginner, Intermediate and Advance. 
For all the three levels, the questions will be of MCQ (Multiple Choice Question)-type, wherein only one option will be the correct answer. Participants will have 60 seconds (1 minute) to answer each question. All the questions will carry 1000-points each. We'll be using the Kahoot platform to host this quiz and so, the score of a participant will be based on two factors - (1) Whether the answer is correct or not, (2) How much time the participant took in answering a question. There will be no negative marking. 

Only one round will be hosted/played at a time in this order - (1) Beginners-Round, (2) Intermediate-Round and (3) Advance-Round. After each round, only the top 50% of the participants will be eligible to play the next round. The selection of such participants will be a transparent process - after each round, the winners will be highlighted on the Kahoot-screen itself and so, there won't be any third party interference while selecting the winners. First-round will be a screening round. The top three winners of the second and third rounds will be awarded for their achievement. Note: The top three winners at the end of the third round will be the ultimate winners of this contest.  </p>
        
            <h2 class="font-weight-bold">Hosting Platform</h2>
            <p>This quiz will be hosted through a live Zoom-session. The session ID/PW will be shared soon. Participants will be required to join the zoom session at-least 5 minutes before the quiz timing. After that, the Kahoot id will be displayed on the zoom screen and the participants will have to open 'kahoot.it' in a different window of their browser and enter this Kahoot-ID there. Once, all the participants have joined the Kahoot session from their devices, the quiz will begin and all the questions, along with the MCQ options, will be hosted on the zoom screen. It's recommended that the participants use a different device (phone/tablet/laptop) to join the Kahoot session through 'kahoot.it'</p>
